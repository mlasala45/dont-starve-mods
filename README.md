# Don't Starve Mods
In 2015-2016 (when I was 16) I made a series of mods for the game Don't Starve. The game is prone to breaking mods when it pushes out updates, so eventually it wasn't worth maintaining them, especially as I moved on to other projects. I don't expect them to function in modern versions of the game.

You can find the official pages for the mods here, including their patch history: https://steamcommunity.com/id/arkathorn/myworkshopfiles/

#### EndoxinAPI
A modular framework designed to provide various features for other mods, which I found myself having to manually implement repeatedly. The mod includes documentation in a series of RTF files. Designed for developer use.
Features include a series of upgrades to the capabilities of the crafting recipe and research system, helpful utility functions, flavor mechanics, and a system for developers to register and travel to new worlds on-demand.

#### Myst
My favorite of these, this was inspired by the MystCraft mod for Minecraft, which was inspired by the Myst series of games.
It adds the ability to craft "Descriptive Books" which let the user teleport to newly generated worlds, and "Linking Books" to teleport back and forth.
The mod leverages the World Registry system of EndoxinAPI.

#### Tropical Vacation
I made this mod in the first several hours that the Shipwrecked DLC was released to the public (making it the first mod released for that DLC), and later refined it as game updates were released.
It's a simple mod that lets players craft a portal that connects a Base Game savefile to a Shipwrecked savefile, dropping items that don't exist in both versions. The extra savefile is hidden, and can't be accessed by other means. (It's also deleted when the original savefile is deleted.)

#### Magma and Meteors
These two mods are ports of features from DST, the multiplayer sequel to Don't Starve, which is built similarly and shares parts of its codebase with Don't Starve.
